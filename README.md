# Dalim Software internship

In this repository, you will find all the files need to build the pdf version
of my internship report for the university. The content is written in French.


## Build requirements

To build all the pdf version of the report you will need the following
dependencies installed on your machine:

  - `pandoc`: used here to convert all the Markdown files to pdf

  - `texlive-lang-french`: support for the french langage

  - `xelatex`: installable on Debian-based distributions with
               `sudo apt install texlive-xetex`
               (used for compiling the cover page from *tex->pdf*)

To build the pdf file for the report, just run `make`, `make all`,
`make report` or `make pdf`.
